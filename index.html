					<li><a href="https://github.com/thekevinmo/charts"><strong>iTunes Analyzer</strong></a>: A tool for analyzing and computing statistics on listening behavior for those who archive music in iTunes via .mp3 downloads or Apple Music.
					<br><br>
					Conduct a search for "iTunes Music Library.xml" on your computer and place this file in the same directory as the executible of this project. The file should be renamed to "<i>name</i>-library.xml", where you substitute "<i>name</i>" with whatever you'd like. This naming scheme allows you to collect various friends' libraries and anaylze each by only sharing XML files.
					<br><br>
					When running the program in your command line, the only argument you need to provide is the "<i>name</i>" at the beginning of the library you want to analyze. For example, if my library file is named shayan-library.xml, I would run the program and provide just the argument "shayan" (with no quotation marks). The text-based interface for the interactive portion of the program is specified at runtime.
