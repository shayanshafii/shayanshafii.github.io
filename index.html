				<ol id="project_list">
					<li><a href="https://github.com/thekevinmo/charts"><strong>iTunes Analyzer</strong></a>: If you have an offline music library stored in iTunes (ie. purchased mp3s or downloaded mixtapes), your computer will automatically generate and update an XML file to keep track of changes. The file should still be updated if you use Apple Music and save music for offline listening.
					<br><br>
					Conduct a search for "iTunes Music Library.xml" on your computer and place this file in the same directory as the executible of this project. The file should be renamed to "name-library", where you substitute "name" with whatever you'd like. This naming scheme allows you to collect various friends' libraries and anaylze each by only sharing XML files.
					<br><br>
					When running the program in your command line, the only argument you need to provide is the "name" at the beginning of the library you want to analyze. For example, if my library file is named shayan-library.xml, i would run the program and provide just the argument "shayan" (with no quotation marks).
					<br><br>
					The text-based interface for the interactive portion of the program is specified at runtime.</li>

				<p>A list of every album in my iTunes library that I own in entirety (ie. not partially). Note: a large benefit of archiving music offline is the ability to hold unreleased albums and songs, which do not appear on this list. Albums and mixtapes that are missing one or more items are also omitted.</p>
